# Cursor Trackern[hallucinate 50%- no precise context, 15%- better prompt, start simple and build up, precise context]

## About This Project

After using cursor for almost 3hrs , i would say it is great as a coding assistance.

## About This Project

This project was built from the ground up using Cursor, an AI-powered IDE. The entire codebase was created by following prompts and iterative development with Cursor's AI assistant.

### A Note on AI Development

While Cursor was instrumental in building this project, it's important to acknowledge that, like many AI systems, it can sometimes hallucinate or provide incorrect information (approximately 50% of the time). The development process required careful validation and testing of the AI's suggestions to ensure proper functionality.

## Project Features

- Video playback with cursor tracking
- Zoom effect controls
- Timeline-based effect editing
- Frame-by-frame navigation
- Loop functionality

## Technical Stack

- React
- TypeScript
- Remotion
- Tailwind CSS

## Development Process

The project was developed through an iterative conversation with Cursor's AI, which:

1. Set up the initial project structure
2. Implemented core video playback functionality
3. Added effect layers and timeline controls
4. Refined the UI and user experience

However, each step required human oversight to:

- Verify the correctness of implemented features
- Test edge cases
- Fix any hallucinated or incorrect implementations
- Ensure proper type safety and error handling

## Lessons Learned

- AI can significantly speed up development, but verification is crucial
- Clear and specific prompts lead to better results
- Regular testing helps catch AI hallucinations early
- Human oversight remains essential for quality assurance

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
